# Lokl configuration file example
#
# Add to a $HOME/.lokl/templates/ directory
#
# This will allow you to choose to create a site from template
#
# Initially, allowing you to set volumes to mount
#
# Future versions may add extra functionality, like installing 
#  extra plugins/themes, etc during provisioning
#
# Usage:
#
# Name the template file for recognition, ie default-php8-mount-my-plugins
#
# Template selection is offered after choosing a name for your site,
#  if your $HOME/.lokl/templates/ directory contains any valid templates
#
# Required template fields:
#
# VOLUMES
#
# In format SOURCE:DESTINATION
#
# I chose to risk the case of not working with volumes containing colons
#  in path in order to keep simple. If the bug is raised, I can look at
#  --mount instead.
